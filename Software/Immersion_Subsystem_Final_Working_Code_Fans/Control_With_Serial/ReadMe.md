This code allows the user to input values ranging from 0-255 into the serial monitor and control the fans PWM duty cycle.

While primitive in nature and in need of improvement, this code allows you to experiment with the fan at different speeds through direct input rather than through a connection with the Raspberry Pi.

To run, ensure that the fan is powered and the grounds of the Fan, Power supply, and Arduino are connected. Then make sure that Pin9 of the Arduino is connected to the blue PWM wire of the fan. The Raspberry Pi is not needed to run this code.
