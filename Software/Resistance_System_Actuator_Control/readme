This folder contains all the necessary code to run the linear actuator on the raspberry pi.

Once the workmap has been uploaded in a text file (WorkMapTest.txt), ActuatorControl.py pulls the file into an array which then is iterated through the equation in the Signoff.
To send the distance of the actuator (mm) to the actuator, it must be scaled by 0.1068 (Approximately. This value needs further calibration by testing each value with the actual distance.).
