To set up the Work Map creation code you can find it in /scripts/testing/new as Work_Subsystem.py on the ride replay kit raspberry pi. You will need to power the Raspberry pi using a battery and start it either using an ssh or a hdmi plus keyboard. When you are finished jump the 35th pin to the 33rd pin and a workmap.txt will be created. The code will take pressure measurements every pass of the backwheel and will create an array using these values. These values can then be passed to the resistance subsystems code to be converted to height then to potential energy then to a workmap to be used by the resistance subsystem.
