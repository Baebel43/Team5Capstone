  This folder contains the GitHub to install Flowframes. Flowframes was used to interpolate the video recording from 60FPS to 240FPS to ensure smoothness of the replay at lower replay speeds.

  To use Flowframes, first go to the "Interpolation" tab and select "Browse (Folder)" on the right of the app, and select the video to be interpolated. Under the dropdown next to "Input FPS" select the value that brings the video closest to 240FPS. Next ensure that the "Interpolation AI" selected in the dropdown corresponds with the GPU that is in the system that is being used to interpolate the video. Now click "Interpolate!" at the bottom left of the app, and wait for the video to be interpolated. The interpolated video will be in the same folder as the source video.

  It should be mentioned that having a GPU is greatly reccommended for interpolating to ensure that the interpolation is done within a reasonable amount of time.
