This folder contains all code needed to allow the load cells to detect weight. 

Here is the link to the Amazon product where many helpful comments on setting up can be found:

For the HX711 board, here is the link for example code:

The Master.ino and Slave.ino code is for BLE transmission of the weight values (in lbs) from an Arduino IOT (slave) on the pedals and an Arduino IOT (master) which connects to the raspberry pi.

Helpful hints:
Make sure there is space below the load cells for the middle to bend. 
Keep the same calibration factor
