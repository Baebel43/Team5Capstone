|Off Switch|To allow the user to turn off the fan output when riding, an off switch was implemented into the GUI of the device. This switch is a toggle that limits the output of the fans once pressed. Once the option is pressed, the send data variable that initially reads from the sensor is replaced with a 0 value so that the fans are not receiving new inputs from the bike. This remains implemented until the user presses the switch again and allows the fan to read from the sensor.|This was tested by running the program and pressing the switch multiple times during the bike's functional period. At each point in time that the switch was pressed, the fans displayed that they were receiving a value of zero and no longer outputted. This switch follows the off button constraint that was set therefore this constraint is fulfilled.|YES||
