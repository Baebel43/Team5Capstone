# Lessons Learned

This document should have a section for each team member. Each engineer should respond to these:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

Create a subsection addressing each of the above questions in your section of the document.

  For my subsystem most things went well the only thing that didn't go well is the accuracy of the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor is currently inaccurate by about 3 feet and I believe that could be further improved. Some unanticipated problems that occured is the idea of what should happen if there was a perfectly flat trail recording. Currently there is no set solution to the problem since it's purely hypothetical, but since the user on the bike and on the trail would just have to pedal the bike the back actuator shouldn't place any resistance on the back flywheel. If I were to go back and do it over again I would spend more time reviewing the previous teams work and understanding what exactly they were trying to do with specific systems. The best practice that I have identified are keeping backups of everything. You never know when you might need it. The words of wisdom I would like to relay is always be willing to help your teammates since later on they would be willing to help you. Some new knowledge that I aquired during capstone is teamwork, B field calculations, python coding, coding on an ubuntu interface, and many mathematical concepts.
