# Ride Replay System 

## Executive Summary

Currently, there are no commercially available devices that officially allow people to ride a personal recording of a trail, Team 5 aims to change this with the Ride Replay Kit. The Ride Replay Kit aims to offer users the ability to replay a trail recorded anywhere with the same difficulty and immersion as if the rider was actually on that trail.


## Capabilities

This project is currently still in the planning phase, this document currently houses the signoffs by Team 5â€™s stakeholder along with images and related schematics.

## Salient Outcomes

## Project Demonstration & Images

Right now Team 5 is still in the planning stage of the Ride Replay Kit, once there are videos and images of demonstrations they will be placed here.
